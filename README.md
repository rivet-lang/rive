A general purpose programming language, focused on simplicity, safety and stability.

</div>

Rivet's goal is to be a very powerful programming language and at the same time easy
to use, with a syntax inspired mainly by Rust and C# (which are the coolest languages
I've ever seen), and by other languages such as Python, Lua, TypeScript, etc.

## Features

* Easy-to-learn syntax.
* Non-null values.
* Named and optional arguments.
* Easy error handling.
* SumTypes.
* Struct inheritance and polymorphism.

## Run the compiler

To run the compiler you must have Python 3 and Pip3 installed.

You must also install `llvmlite` and `lark`:

```bash
$ sudo pip install lark llvmlite
```

Then just run `python3 rivetc.py`.
