A general-purpose language, designed for the safe, fast and stable creation
of software.

</div>

Rivet's goal is to be a very powerful programming language and at the same time easy
to use, with a syntax inspired mainly by Rust and C# (which are the coolest languages
I've ever seen), and by other languages such as Python, Lua, TypeScript, etc.

## Features

* Easy-to-learn syntax.
* Non-null values.
* SumTypes.
* Named and optional arguments.
* Result types for error handling.
* Struct inheritance and polymorphism.
* And much more!.
